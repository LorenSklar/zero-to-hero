  <h1 class="section-title">Why Us?</h1>
  <p>
    Too many first time founders stall out between idea and MVP.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dev shops are slow, expensive, and often deliver something that doesnâ€™t match your vision.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    AI tools promise speed but generate brittle code that breaks every time you try to revise it.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Be Your Own CTO Bootcamp </strong> helps you build an MVP fast, change it often, and control exactly how it works, all at a fraction of the cost.
