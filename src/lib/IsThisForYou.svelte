  <h1 class="section-title">Is This For You?</h1>
  <p> <strong>Be Your Own CTO Bootcamp</strong> is for you if:
  <ul>
    <li>✅ You have a real product idea but no clue how to start. </li>
    <li>✅ You tried AI tools but the code broke with every change as your idea evolved. </li>
    <li>✅ You want to test your idea but are stuck waiting on someone else to build the MVP. </li>
    <li>✅ You are ready to build, learn, and own your MVP. </li>
    <li>❌ This is NOT for founders who prefer pitching ideas over validating them. </li>
  </ul>
