<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>For 6 weeks, you code and I coach with just enough help from AI coding tools to write the code.</p>

<h5>Week 1: Clarify Your Idea</h5>
<p>Nail down exactly what problem your MVP will solve and for whom. Define success so you know what you're aiming for. This is your roadmap.</p>

<h5>Week 2: Design Your MVP</h5>
<p>This is the secret sauce. AI can't do it for you. Dev shops charge a fortune for it.</p>
<p>We break your idea into achievable steps. You design it. You own it. You can change it anytime with no developers, no waiting, no AI gibberish.</p>

<h5>Week 3: Learn Just Enough Code to Be Dangerous</h5>
<p>You don’t need to be a developer, but you will learn to read code and how to maintain it. Just enough Python and HTML/CSS to understand your app and fix what your AI tool writes without help.</p>

<h5>Week 4: Build Your MVP Step-by-Step</h5>
<p>Guided by your coach with an assist from AI coding tools, you assemble your MVP piece by piece. No guessing, no outsourcing. You’re in control and building for real users.</p>

<h5>Week 5: Launch and Collect Real Feedback</h5>
<p>Ship it. Collect feedback and data from users. Find out fast what works and what doesn’t.</p>

<h5>Week 6: Pivot or Persist. You Decide</h5>
<p>With real data, make your move. Improve, pivot, or scale. You’ve launched. That’s already ahead of 95% of founders.</p>
