<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>We work side-by-side for 6 weeks.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Refine your MVP:</strong> Clarify your idea and define your first user journey. Cut everything else.</li>
  <li><strong>Build your MVP:</strong> Use modern, real code (Svelte + Python) to ship something you own.</li>
  <li><strong>Test & Learn:</strong> Launch. Get users. Gather real feedback and data you can use to iterate. or walk away with clarity.</li>
</ol>
